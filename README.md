### Linux-Multi-Boot-OS-tinkering

There's a saying that "The best teacher is experience", then why not try teaching yourself about Linux in general while installing it manually?

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository documents my experiments with setting up and managing **dual, triple, and even quadruple boot** Linux environments.  
The project focuses on:
- Installing multiple Linux distributions (Debian-based & Arch-based) on a single machine
- Configuring and troubleshooting the **GRUB bootloader and the OS Prober**
- Customizing **desktop environments** (Hyperland)

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Linux system administration (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Kali, Mint)
- GRUB bootloader management & multi-boot troubleshooting
- Desktop environment installation & customization
- Shell scripting for automation
- System recovery from bootloops and conflicts

## 🚀 Setup Workflow
1. Partition storage to prepare multiple root systems  
2. Install Linux distributions (manually or with script assistance)  
3. Configure GRUB bootloader for all detected distros  
4. Customize desktop environments (Hyperland, GNOME, XFCE, etc.)  
5. Automate repetitive tasks with shell scripts
